SWGEmu World Spawner Tool Lua
=============================

This is a tool to control the various regions on each planet. It is written in Lua and requires wxLua to run.

Limitations
-----------
 * The user has to ensure that wxLua is available, download and build wxWidgets and wxLua according to http://wxlua.sourceforge.net/docs/install.html
 * Can only be run from the WorldSpawnerToolLua directory currently.
 * Hard coded paths taken from the newest dev environment.
 * Can only show the regions so far, no way of editing them yet.
